Great question 👍 — this is where **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** in Auth0 comes in.
You’ll create **Permissions** → assign them to **Roles** → assign roles to **Users**.

Here’s exactly how you do it:

---

## 🪜 Step 1 — Enable RBAC in Auth0

1. Log into the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/).
2. In the left sidebar, go to **Applications → APIs**.
3. Find the **Default API** (`Auth0 Management API`) or create your own custom API (recommended for your app).

   * Click **Create API**.
   * Fill in:

     * **Name**: e.g., `MyApp API`
     * **Identifier**: e.g., `https://myapp-api` (this will be the `audience`)
     * Signing algorithm: **RS256**
   * Save.
4. Open your new API and go to **Settings** → enable:

   * ✅ **RBAC**
   * ✅ **Add Permissions in the Access Token**

This makes sure Auth0 includes permissions in the JWT your app receives.

---

## 🪜 Step 2 — Create Permissions

1. Still inside your API (e.g., `MyApp API`), go to the **Permissions** tab.
2. Click **Create Permission**.
3. Define your permissions — one by one. Example for your case:

   * `users:create`
   * `users:read`
   * `users:update`
   * `users:delete`
   * `sales:read`
   * `sales:create`
   * `marketing:read`
   * `marketing:create`
   * etc.

💡 These strings are **your own design** — they just need to be consistent across backend/frontend.

---

## 🪜 Step 3 — Create Roles

1. In the left sidebar, go to **User Management → Roles**.

2. Click **Create Role**.

3. For each role, give a name and description:

   * `Admin` → has all permissions
   * `Sales Senior` → `sales:create`, `sales:read`, `sales:update`, `sales:delete`
   * `Sales Junior` → `sales:read` only
   * `Marketing Senior` → `marketing:create`, `marketing:read`, `marketing:update`, `marketing:delete`
   * `Marketing Junior` → `marketing:read` only
   * `Client` → `client:read`

4. When creating/editing a role, go to **Permissions** → click **Add Permissions** → select the ones you created in Step 2.

---

## 🪜 Step 4 — Assign Roles to Users

1. Go to **User Management → Users**.
2. Pick a user.
3. Go to **Roles** tab → **Assign Roles** → choose one (e.g., `Sales Junior`).

Now when that user logs in, their Access Token will contain the permissions you defined.

---

## 🪜 Step 5 — Use Permissions in Your App

When your Next.js app fetches the user’s session (using `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` or direct JWT decode), the token will include:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "sales:read",
    "users:read"
  ],
  "sub": "auth0|abc123",
  "iss": "https://myapp-dev.us.auth0.com/",
  "aud": "https://myapp-api"
}
```

You can now check `permissions` on both frontend (for showing/hiding UI) and backend (for securing API routes).

---

✅ Summary:

1. Create an **API** in Auth0.
2. Add **Permissions** in that API.
3. Create **Roles**, attach permissions.
4. Assign roles to **Users**.
5. Check `permissions` in the JWT inside your app.

---

Do you want me to also give you a **Next.js API middleware example** that checks these Auth0 permissions automatically (so only users with `users:create` can call `/api/users`)?
